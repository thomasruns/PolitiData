OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple script that will pull data on political candidates from the
FEC's FTP site, then update a database with that info. How you use the data is
up to you. The data file contains the following information about each candidate
in a federal election (NOTE: this does not include local or regional elections):

Candidate Identification
Candidate Name
Party Designation No. 1
Party Designation No. 3
Incumb./Challeng./Open-seat
Candidate Status
Street One
Street Two
City or Town
State
Zip Code
Principal Campaign Comm. I.D.
Year of Election
Current District


USE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Place the script in a directory of your choice.
2) Create a sub-directory named 'logs'.
3) Update lines 16-19 with your database info
4) In the database you defined in step 3, create a table named 'candidate' (or
   change the 2 queries in the script to use the table name you choose) and use
   this structure:
   
   1 	candidate_id       bigint(32)       //This isn't related to the FEC data
   2 	fec_id             varchar(9)
   3 	name_candidate     varchar(100)
   4 	party_code         varchar(3)
   5 	party_code2        varchar(3)
   6 	cand_type          varchar(1)
   7 	address1           varchar(50)
   8 	address2           varchar(30)
   9 	city               varchar(30)
   10 	state              varchar(2)
   11 	zip                varchar(10)
   12 	election_year      varchar(2)
   13 	district           varchar(2)
   14 	date_created       datetime         //This isn't related to the FEC data
   15 	date_modified      datetime         //This isn't related to the FEC data
   16 	status_id          int(3)           //This isn't related to the FEC data
5) That's it. Run it! The file is updated every Sunday according to the FEC site
   so if you need ongoing updates you could set a cron job to run every Monday.
6) Check the logs directory for details on each run (inserts vs updates) and/or
   any errors it encountered.
